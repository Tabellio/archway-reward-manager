# Archway Reward Manager

Archway Reward Manager is a platform to make reward and payment related process easier to manage in Archway Network.

## Features

- **User Shares**: Create multiple share structures to distribute rewards and payments to different parties.

- **Custom Contracts**: Create new contracts through the split contract to capture rewards on the split contract, making it earn rewards for every transaction on the custom contract.

- **Contract Lock**: Lock the contract to prevent any further changes to the contract making it more secure.
